## Food Truck Project 

###Overview

The Food Truck application stores data as objects and lets user access a menu according to input

* It prompts user and takes input to create a Food Truck objects array.
* It checks for any null entries in the array and trims array accordingly.
* It displays a menu and takes user input, it then reacts accordingly with the input choice.
